This project, "LLM-Denoiser," appears to be a deep learning solution for audio denoising. It leverages a model, likely a type of recurrent or convolutional neural network, to remove background noise from audio signals.

1.) The workflow is structured into several key scripts:

2.) !pip install -r requirements.txt: This command installs all the necessary Python libraries and dependencies required to run the project.

3.) !python data.py: This script is responsible for preparing the dataset. It likely involves loading clean and noisy audio pairs, processing them into a suitable format (like spectrograms), and creating data loaders for training and testing.

4.) !python train.py: This is the core training script. It defines the neural network architecture, the loss function, and the optimizer. It then iterates through the prepared dataset to train the model to distinguish between the desired audio signal and noise, saving the trained model weights upon completion.

5.) !python infer.py: After training, this script is used for inference. It loads the saved model and applies it to new, noisy audio files to produce cleaned, denoised versions.

6.) !python plot_audio_charts.py: This utility script is used for visualization. It generates plots, such as waveforms or spectrograms, to visually compare the original noisy audio, the clean audio, and the model's denoised output, helping to evaluate the model's performance.

In essence, the project provides a complete pipeline for training an audio denoising model and using it to clean up noisy audio recordings.
