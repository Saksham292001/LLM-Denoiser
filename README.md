## Getting Started

**LLM-Denoiser: Audio Denoising Project
**
This project, "LLM-Denoiser," is a deep learning solution designed for audio denoising. It leverages a sophisticated model, likely a type of recurrent or convolutional neural network, to effectively remove background noise from audio signals.

The project provides a complete, end-to-end pipeline for training an audio denoising model and using it to clean up noisy audio recordings.

Project Workflow
The process is structured into several key scripts. To get started, follow these steps in order:

##Install Dependencies

This command installs all the necessary Python libraries and dependencies required to run the project.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##Prepare the Dataset

This script handles the data preparation. It loads clean and noisy audio pairs, processes them into a suitable format (like spectrograms), and creates data loaders for training and testing.

```bash
python data.py
```

##Train the Model

This is the core training script. It defines the neural network architecture, the loss function, and the optimizer. It then iterates through the dataset to train the model and saves the trained model weights upon completion.

```bash
python train.py
```

##Perform Inference

After training, this script is used for inference. It loads the saved model and applies it to new, noisy audio files to produce cleaned, denoised versions.

```bash
python infer.py
```

##Visualize Results

This utility script is used for visualization. It generates plots (e.g., waveforms or spectrograms) to visually compare the original noisy audio, the clean audio, and the model's denoised output. This helps in evaluating the model's performance.

```bash
python plot_audio_charts.py
```
